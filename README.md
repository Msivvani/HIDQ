## Novelty and innovativeness
- Concept of using self-transforming bot in fields of inspecting inaccessible arenas.
- Using the mobile clutch mechanism (PED) to efficiently transfer power from BLDC to wheels and propellers.
-	Integrating sprawl mechanism and PED for drone to crawl into tight and narrow spaces using reconfigurable geometry.
-	Compared to physical inspection by humans, it is safe, faster, more accurate and avoids the need for scaffolding and avoids any risk to human life.
-	A novel method for the bot to efficiently maneuver and move about any confined space and systems connected at different heights.
-	Convolutional Neural Networking to detect multiple potential defects that is precise, accurate, faster and reduces the workload of the operator.
